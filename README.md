The Supplementary Table, supplementary_info_table_onerva_korhonen.xlsx, contains the detailed information about the Regions of Interest (ROIs) used in the study. We used three different atlases: HarvardOxford (HO), Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL), and Brainnetome. Besides the names and sizes of the ROIs, the Supplementary Table presents the consistency ranks of ROIs in two different datasets: the in-house dataset (13 subjects) and the ABIDE dataset (28 subjects).

The Supplementary Information pdf, supplementary_ryyppo.pdf, describes the detailed results obtained by repeating the analysis of the main article using the in-house data and the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) and HarvardOxford (HO) atlases as well as using the ABIDE dataset and the Brainnetome atlas. Besides, an alternative definition of spatiotemporal consistency is investigated. Further, the Supplementary Methods section describes in detail the selection of time window length and closest neighborhood size as well as details of the ABIDE dataset.
