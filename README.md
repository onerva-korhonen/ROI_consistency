The Supplementary Table, supplementary_info_table_onerva_korhonen.xlsx, contains the detailed information about the Regions of Interest (ROIs) used in the study. We used three different atlases: HarvardOxford (HO), Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL), and Brainnetome. Besides the names and sizes of the ROIs, the Supplementary Table presents the consistency ranks of ROIs in two different datasets: the in-house dataset (13 subjects) and the ABIDE dataset (28 subjects).
